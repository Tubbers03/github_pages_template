You want data that is useful to find the answer to youre question. I went to statmuse and got the standings data from the NFL, NBA, and MLB. I then put the data into data frames.\n\n\n\nThe NFL standings data was sourced from StatMuse:\n- [2024 NFL Standings - StatMuse](https://www.statmuse.com/ask?query=2024+nfl+standings&preferred_domain=&direct=true&l=&t=1759206685574)\nThe NBA standings data was sourced from StatMuse:\n- [2024 NBA Standings - StatMuse](https://www.statmuse.com/nba/ask/nba-2024-standings)\nThe MLB standings data was sourced from StatMuse:\n- [2024 MLB Standings - StatMuse](https://www.statmuse.com/mlb/ask/mlb-standings-for-2024)\n\n::: {#3ea94821 .cell execution_count=2}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\nprint(\"NFL Standings (head):\")\nprint(nfl_df.head())\n\nprint(\"\\nNBA Standings (head):\")\nprint(nba_df.head())\n\nprint(\"\\nMLB Standings (head):\")\nprint(mlb_df.head())\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\nNFL Standings (head):\n    Division      Team   W   L  T    PCT   PF   PA   PD   HOME   ROAD\n0   AFC East     Bills  13   4  0  0.765  525  368  157  8-0-0  5-4-0\n1   AFC East  Dolphins   8   9  0  0.471  345  364  -19  5-3-0  3-6-0\n2   AFC East      Jets   5  12  0  0.294  338  404  -66  3-5-0  2-7-0\n3   AFC East  Patriots   4  13  0  0.235  289  417 -128  2-6-0  2-7-0\n4  AFC North    Ravens  12   5  0  0.706  518  361  157  6-2-0  6-3-0\n\nNBA Standings (head):\n  Conference       Team   W   L    PCT   CONF   DIV   HOME   ROAD  L10\n0    Eastern    Celtics  64  18  0.780  41-11  15-2   37-4  27-14  7-3\n1    Eastern     Knicks  50  32  0.610  35-17  12-5  27-14  23-18  6-4\n2    Eastern      Bucks  49  33  0.598  34-18  10-7  31-11  18-22  3-7\n3    Eastern  Cavaliers  48  34  0.585  31-21  11-5  26-15  22-19  4-6\n4    Eastern      Magic  47  35  0.573  32-20   9-7  29-12  18-23  5-5\n\nMLB Standings (head):\n  League Division       Team   W   L    PCT    GB   HOME   ROAD  L10\n0     AL  AL East    Yankees  94  68  0.580   0.0  44-37  50-31  5-5\n1     AL  AL East    Orioles  91  71  0.562   3.0  44-37  47-34  7-3\n2     AL  AL East    Red Sox  81  81  0.500  13.0  38-43  43-38  5-5\n3     AL  AL East       Rays  80  82  0.494  14.0  42-39  38-43  6-4\n4     AL  AL East  Blue Jays  74  88  0.457  20.0  39-42  35-46  2-8\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n## Results in Table Format\n| Sport | Home Win % (2024) |\n|-------|--------------------|\n| NFL   | 0.533              |\n| NBA   | 0.543              |\n| MLB   | 0.521              |\n## Visualizing the Home Advantage\n\n::: {#98dba67d .cell execution_count=3}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\nsports = ['NFL', 'NBA', 'MLB']\nwin_rates = [0.533, 0.543, 0.521]\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\nplt.figure(figsize=(6, 4))\nplt.plot(sports, win_rates, marker='o', linestyle='-', color='blue')\nplt.title('Home Win Percentage by Sport (2024 Season)')\nplt.xlabel('Sport')\nplt.ylabel('Home Win Percentage')\nplt.ylim(0.50, 0.56)\nplt.grid(True)\nplt.tight_layout()\n\nplt.savefig(\"home_win_2024_lineplot.png\")\nplt.show()\n![Home Win Percentage by Sport (2024 Season)](home_win_2024_lineplot.png)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display}\n![](Blog_files/figure-html/cell-4-output-1.png){width=566 height=374}\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\nzsh:1: bad pattern: [Home\r\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n## A Bit of Math: Interpreting Win Rate\n\n## Conclusion: The Advantage Is Real (Sometimes)\n\n## Call to Action: Dig Deeper!\n\n",
